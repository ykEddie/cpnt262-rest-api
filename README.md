I didn't copy and paste the code but some of my code is based off of Tony's in class example with the Disney API.

### Code Journal

This assignment was very difficult, not only because I couldn't find an API that met the requirements for the assignments
  - could not find api's with images
  - a lot of them were just text with no image data or urls
  - some had only images and no other data
  - found a good food api but the url that needed to be pasted into the endpoint variable was nowhere to be found 
    - Once you get to the [site](https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com/) there is nothing to copypaste

Once I found an API that worked with an endpoint that had all the requirements I was then able to proceed more smoothly.

I watched one of the [lecture recordings](https://sait-ca.zoom.us/rec/play/UDmCMMShxwvk-ViarZDpXGz2_oGlUC4aQc0a-ST7nORIFhbCYiA2D-AdeKjCehcc-5xMD7fGZrt3O8M_.UxSx6CAbqdnKdakU?continueMode=true&_x_zm_rtaid=U9XAgavRTY65ZxJC3zsPTQ.1645661375472.2450d61a8854f70c8454ba1cb7b00bff&_x_zm_rhtaid=497) and it was very useful.

  - However at this point my brain is fried and I forgot how to add a button properly

I also wasn't sure about the error handling because all the data for this API was all there.
